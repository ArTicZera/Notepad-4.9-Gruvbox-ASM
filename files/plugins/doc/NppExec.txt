 v0.2 RC2 - December 2007
 ------------------------
 + speeding up the console output
 + watching for changes in "npes_saved.txt"
 + TAB-key in the console auto-completes current command
 + several cosmetic improvements
 
 
 v0.2 RC1 - December 2007
 ------------------------
 1. A lot of internal changes/improvements.
 In particular, now all plugin's options are stored, read and written by the
 Options Manager component.
 The Warning Analyzer component, developed by Nicolas Babled, allows to filter
 and recognize different compiler/interpretter error and warning messages - and
 extract useful information from these messages (such as file name and line 
 number).
 The Simple Logger component stores detailed information about last executed
 command (can be usefull for "debugging").
 * The console redirecting engine has been improved.
 * Now the plugin identifies itself by its dll-file name. Each copy of the 
 plugin (each dll-file) stores its options in corresponding ini-file.
 * Now plugin's environment variables (e.g. "$(FILE_NAME)") are available for
 child console process. For example, start "cmd.exe" and type "echo $(#1)".
 * Now system's environment variables are available in a form of "$(SYS.<var>)"
 e.g. "$(SYS.WINDIR)", "$(SYS.TEMP)" etc.
 * Now the NPP_EXEC command can pass arguments to the script. These arguments 
 can be accessed in the script through the following macro-variables:
 $(ARGC), $(ARGV), $(ARGV[n]).
 Example:  npp_exec "script name" param_1 "param 2".
 This example sets the following values for the script:
 $(ARGC) = 3;  $(ARGV) = param_1 "param 2";  $(ARGV[0]) = script name;
 $(ARGV[1]) = param_1;  $(ARGV[2]) = param 2.
 * Each command now have detailed help information. Type "help" or "help help" 
 in the NppExec's Console.
 * Now the console commands history is restored when you restart Notepad++.

 2. New menu items:
 Direct Execute Previous - directly executes previous script.
 No internal messages - do not show such messages as "Process started >>>", etc.
 Save all files on execute - saves all files before executing a script.
 Also NppExec's toolbar icon has been added.

 3. New dialog:  Console Output Filter -> Highlight.
 This dialog allows you to specify a string mask for compiler/interpretter error 
 and warning messages with such keywords as %FILE%, %ABSFILE% and %LINE%.
 These messages can be highlighted with different colours and allow you to go
 to certain line in certain file when double-clicked in the Console window.

 4. New messages:
 NPP_SAVEALL - saves all modified files.
 CON_LOADFROM - loads a file's content to the Console.
 CON_SAVETO - saves the Console's content to a file.
 ECHO - prints a text in the Console (supports internal env. variables)
 SET - sets the value of user's variable
 UNSET - removes user's variable
 
 
 v0.2 beta4 - July 2007
 ----------------------
 - fixed: buffer size was not checked before calling OemToChar() 
 - fixed/added: '\b' and '\r' handling
 + a lot of changes in plugin's internals (basic cpp-classes and NppExecEngine)
 + new command: cd, cd <path>, cd <drive:\path>
 + new command: dir, dir <mask>, dir <path\mask>
 + new feature: npp_open <mask>, npp_open <path\mask>

 + Menu: Console Commands History.
     When enabled, previous commands can be scrolled by pressing 
     arrow keys Up and Down.
 + Menu: Console Output Filter.
     When enabled, output messages from running console process
     can be filtered (i.e. particular lines can be excluded)
 - ConsoleDlg: Ctrl+A is unlocked
 - ConsoleDlg: Quotes "" are no more added automatically for paths
     with spaces (because of a bug with executables w/o extension
     such as "cmd /c calc.exe")
